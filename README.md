## What is Yumi?

Yumi is a Chrome extension that adds an animated AI companion to any webpage. She remembers your conversations, speaks with a natural voice, can see what's on your screen, and helps you browse the web.

## Features

### Animated Live2D Avatar
A beautiful animated companion that reacts to conversations with expressions, eye tracking, and lip-synced speech.

### Memory System
Yumi remembers what you tell her - your preferences, projects, and past conversations. She recalls relevant information when you need it.

### Voice Chat
Natural text-to-speech powered by ElevenLabs. Yumi speaks her responses with lip-synced animations.

### Vision
Yumi can see your screen. Right-click on any image or take a screenshot to discuss what you're looking at.

### Web Search
Ask Yumi about current events, prices, or anything that needs fresh information. She'll search the web and summarize results.

### Page Awareness
Yumi understands the page you're viewing. Ask her about articles, code, or any content on the current page.
